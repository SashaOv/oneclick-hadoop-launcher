One Click Hadoop Launcher
=========================

One Click Hadoop Launcher is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) plugin that allows to shorten the compile-deploy-test
cycle of Hadoop development to under a minute, even if you are on the VPN.

More importantly, you can associate the
plugin with a button in your IntelliJ IDE (maybe Eclipse as well) so you can execute the whole compile-deploy-run
sequence with one button click.
Done many times a day, this saves you mental energy by not needing to switch context to "deployment mode".
